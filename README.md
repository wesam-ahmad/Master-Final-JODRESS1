## üßê PROJECT BRIEF <a name = "about"></a>  

JO-DRESS is an online platform that offers a wide selection of high-quality rental dresses for various occasions.

Whether you need a dress for a wedding, gala, prom, or any special event, JO-DRESS offers an extensive collection of designer dresses to suit every style and size and it is an innovative  platform that connects fashion-conscious individuals who have unused dresses in their closets with potential renters. Our mission is to create a sustainable and cost-effective way for people to access a wide variety of stylish dresses while enabling dress owners to monetize their unused wardrobe items. Whether you're a fashionista looking for unique dresses or someone seeking to earn extra income from your unused wardrobe, JO-DRESS is the perfect platform for you.
